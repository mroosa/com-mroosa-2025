I am a full-stack developer with over 20 years experience creating accessible, comprehensive, and scalable web experiences. My experience as a full-stack developer allows me to solve design challenges while creating straight-forward and maintainable solutions to best serve the needs of the client. I have developed and maintained small and large-scale websites for businesses, schools, and non-profits in the greater Philadelphia area, working with Comcast/Xfinity, AARP, Cheshire Law Group, and many more.

When I am not working or watching my kids at their school sport events, I enjoy gaming on my custom-built PC, buidling and designing with LEGO, and practicing real-life and in-game photography. I have been interested in programming since I was a kid, learning other programming languages that appealed to my problem-solving nature while looking for fun and creative ways to put the code the use.
